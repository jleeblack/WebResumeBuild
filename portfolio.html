            <p>I wrote this code as a project for extracurricular credit in CIDM 2315.</p>
            <p>With this project I was focused on creating a structured and engaging version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It manages game flow, user input validation, and player interactions and utilizes a while loop to control game rounds while employing encapsulation through the HumanPlayer class to protect and manipulate player points. User input for the human player decision is thoroughly validated, ensuring that only valid choices (rock, paper, or scissors) are accepted. The code also demonstrates the use of the Random class to generate unpredictable computer decisions, enhancing the game's realism. Additionally, it offers the option to restart the game when the player reaches zero points, providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience. My intent was to showcase my C# programming skills, object-oriented design principles, and effective user interface feedback, making it a great example of simple C# game development.</p>

            <p>I wrote this code as the final project for CIDM 2315.</p>
            <p>This C# program showcases my expertise in creating a user-friendly hotel room reservation system. It offers a seamless menu-driven experience for both hotel staff and managers, guiding users through tasks like checking room availability, guest check-ins, and check-outs. The program also demonstrates robust data persistence, ensuring that room reservations are securely stored in a file for retrieval even through different program sessions.</p>
            <p>One feature I enjoyed implementing was the admin menu that is accessible only to authorized users and allowed the utilization of additional and more poweful functions to clear and test/validate output results. I feel this design demonstrated my grasp of user roles and permissions, providing an added layer of security by restricting access to critical functions like data clearing. Overall, my goal was for this program to reflect not only technical proficiency in C# but also my thought approach to user interface and data management.</p>

            <p>This C# code was used to showcase my ability to handle complex user input scenarios.</p>
            <p>In the first part, the program detects whether the user has entered two or four positive integers and identifies and reacts accordingly. It handles various user input scenarios gracefully, such as two or four integers, avoiding clumsy user input prompts. By splitting the input into an array of strings, it effectively processes the numbers and finds the largest among them. This part demonstrated my ability to handle complex input scenarios and make the user experience more intuitive.</p>
            <p>In the second part, the code implements a user account creation process. It prompts the user to enter a username, password (twice for confirmation), and birth year. It then checks the users age based on the birth year and compared the entered passwords for correctness. This section illustrates my capacity to create user-friendly interfaces, validate user inputs, and implement conditional logic effectively.</p>
